If you have already gathered all the components, let’s get started.

## Know something about breadboard

Here are some pictures that will illustrate the basic principles of a breadboard. They can help you establish a solid foundation and will come in handy for the subsequent wiring sections.

There are numbers and letters in the middle region, the tracks of letters a-e and f-j for the same number are connected, while tracks for different numbers are not connected.

## Add power lines, voltage regulator and capacitor
