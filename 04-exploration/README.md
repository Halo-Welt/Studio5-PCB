# 2. Sound of nature

![A industrial equipment operating underwater creates a ‘wuuuuu~’ sound, as the water's flow stirs up a ‘ummmmm~’ sound, harmonizing with the cicadas' song ‘innnnn~’ in the trees. Together, humans and nature compose a symphony.](./images/sound.jpg)

Generally speaking, I enjoyed this fieldwork though I was suffering from mosquito. I will do it continually.
